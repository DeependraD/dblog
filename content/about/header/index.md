  Hi!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Currently, I work as a tenured faculty in Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU) Nepal. I have been mentoring as well guiding undergraduate students of Agriculture faculty in courses relating to Plant Breeding and Genetics since April 2019, long since acquiring the tenure. I cherish having had experience in seed industry before falling back to academia again. In the seed production and processing company, I worked as seed production officer and seed researcher. While taking up a job in role of crop development officer at a government run seed laboratory, I was fortunate to meet with practices and challenges of seed certification allthewhile working to improving laboratory workflows.

I specialize in designing and handling research trials. While in seed industry, I engaged in organization, analysis and visualization of seed production and certification data. My hobbies mostly relate to making sense of crop production dynamics, identifying sources of variation, analysis and inference of biological data and visualization. Occassionally, I run and play soccer, if and when chance favors.
