  At different occassions I have jabbed myself to awefully curate (Mostly, compiling other times authoring myself) some useful contents (articles and blogs). Please don't be intimidated by the style and coverage of the contents -- I'm working on making it more comprehensive. Meanwhile, concerning majority of contents in this site, I shamelessly disclose that most were assembeled plain copy-text while I was and still am sifting through mostly coding and research stuffs deemed valuable to myself.
