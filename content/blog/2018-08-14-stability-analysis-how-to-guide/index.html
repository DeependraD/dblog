<h1>Meaning of stability</h1>
<p>Comparison of treatments may also imply cross comparison of their stability across multiple environments, especially when a study constitutes a series of trials that are each conducted at different locations and/or at different periods in time (henceforth referred to as MET; <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>E</strong>nvironment <strong>T</strong>rial). Several situations exist where only mean based performance analysis are regarded inconclusive.</p>
<p>For example, in varietal release process the authorizing body seeks record of consistent trait performace of certain crop genotype. The imperative is: a variety needs to be stably exhibit it’s characters in the proposed domain of cultivation, which generally is a wide area, throughout a long duration of cultivation cycles. This pre-condition of stable character inheritance is more relevant to crops constituting a homogenous and homozygous population. Either of the location, time period or combination of both, more commonly framed as year in field researches, could be assumed to present an unique environment that treatment entries are tested in. Thus, for results to be widely applicable, performance measures across environments should be more or less stable. To the contrary, the concept of utilizing differential character expression across different environments is often explored when interaction between genotypes and environments result in more desirable character.</p>
<p>In MET trials, it is also of interest whether the same treatments perform well or poorly in all locations, or are there as-yet-unknown subpopulations such that some treatments perform optimally at certain types of locations whereas other treatments are better suited for other locations<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-littell2007sas" role="doc-biblioref">Littell et al. 2007</a>)</span>. By assessing the simple effects of treatments at each location using the BLUPs demonstrated in this example, the stability issue can be addressed using mixed model methods.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>GE has been a research focus among biometricians and quantitative geneticists since the early 1900s. With the notion that GE is undesirable and/or that it confounds genotype evaluation, much work has been devoted to developing stability indices to quantify and select against GE. Many stability indices have been proposed, as reviewed in Lin and Binns (1994) and more recently in Yan and Kang (2003). Several books and symposium proceedings have been published to document the advances in the study of GE (Byth and Montgomery1981; Kang, 1990, 2003; Gauch 1992; Imrie and Hacker 1993; Kang and Gauch 1996; Cooper and Hammer 1996) and most earlier research on GE can be traced from these publications.[copied]</p>
<p>Two concepts exist that aim to explain the stability – static/biological stability and dynamic/agronomic stability. The concept of static stability maintains that the genotypic response of a trait remains unchanged over environment, i.e. a genotype has equally same response across all environments. This concept is defines stability in absolute stringent terms, which actually is never the case when dealing with natural components.The other concept, dynamic stability, attempts to associate stability with predictive performance. It highlights the importance of statistical agreement between the predicted performance and the observed performance.</p>

<h1>Principles of Biplot analysis</h1>
<p>A biplot is a scatter plot that approximates and graphically displays a two-way table by both its row and column factors such that relationships among the row factors, relationships among the column factors, and the underlying interactions between the row and column factors can be visualized simultaneously. Since its first report by Gabriel (1971), biplots have been used in visual data analysis by scientists of all disciplines, from economics, sociology, business, medicine, to ecology, genetics, and agronomy. The first application of biplots to agricultural data analysis was Bradu and Gabriel (1978), who used data from a cotton performance trial to illustrate the diagnostic role of biplots for model selection.</p>
<p>A common misconception is that biplot analysis is equivalent to principle component analysis (PCA). While both biplot analysis and PCA use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Pearson 1901) as a key mathematical technique, biplot analysis is a fuller use of SVD to allow two interacting factors to be visualized simultaneously.</p>
<div id="biplot-and-its-inner-product-property" class="section level2">
<h2>Biplot and its Inner-product Property</h2>
<p>Mathematically, a biplot may be regarded as a graphical display of matrix multiplication. Given a matrix <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> rows and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> columns, and a matrix <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> rows and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> columns, they can be multiplied to give a third matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> rows and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> columns. If <strong>r = 2</strong>, then matrix <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> can be displayed as <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> points in a 2-D plot, with the 1st column as the abscissa (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis) and 2nd column the ordinate (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis). Similarly, matrix <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> can be displayed as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points in a 2-D plot, with the 1st row as the abscissa and 2nd row the ordinate. A 2-D biplot is formed if the two plots are superimposed, which would contain <span class="math inline">\(m + n\)</span> points. An interesting property of this biplot is that it not only displays matrices <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, but also implicitly displays the <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> values of matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, because each element of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> can be visualized as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p_{ij} = x_ix^\prime_j + y_iy^\prime_j = \vec{g_i}\vec{e_i} = |g_i||e_j|\cos\theta_{ij}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span> are the coordinates for row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((x\prime_j, y\prime_j)\)</span> are the coordinates for column j. <span class="math inline">\(\vec{g_i}\)</span> is the vector for row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{e_i}\)</span> is the vector for column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(|g_i|\)</span> is the vector length for row i and <span class="math inline">\(|e_j|\)</span> is the vector length for column j. <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{ij}\)</span> is the angle between the vectors of row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and column <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>The founder of biplot (Gabriel 1971) summarizes biplot analysis as any two-way table can be graphically analyzed using a 2-D biplot as soon as it can be sufficiently approximated by a rank-2 (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> = 2) matrix.</p>
<p><strong>Example: 1</strong></p>
<p>Let us consider two matrices, matrix <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and matrix <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> as shown below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
G = \left[
\begin{matrix}
2 &amp; 4 \\
2 &amp; 3 \\
4 &amp; -3 \\
-2 &amp; -1 \\
\end{matrix}
\right]
;\
E = \left[
\begin{matrix}
6 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\
3 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\
\end{matrix}
\right]
\]</span></p>
<p>Now by cross multiplying (vector multiplication) of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, we get <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> matrix:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P =
\left[
\begin{matrix}
24 &amp; 6 &amp; -16 \\
21 &amp; 7 &amp; -14 \\
15 &amp; 23 &amp; -10 \\
-15 &amp; -9 &amp; 10 \\
\end{matrix}
\right]
\]</span></p>
<p>The matrix is a “rank 2” matrix. Taking a graphical approach, we can visualize the above two matrices; we can overlay the plottings of matrices in a way stated above to obtain a graph of <span class="math inline">\(m+n\)</span> points where, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> = number of rows in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> matrix and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = number of columns in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> matrix.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The proof about approximation of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> matrix can be shown geometrically, i.e.:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_{ij} = \vec{R_i}cos\alpha_{ij}\vec{C_j};\\
\vec{R_i} = \sqrt{x^2_{R_i} + y^2_{R_i}},~\vec{C_j} = \sqrt{x^2_{C_j} + y^2_{C_j}}
\]</span></p>
<p>First, to determine the segment length, we compute the distance between the corresponding point and the centre.</p>
<pre><code>## [1] 4.47 3.61 5.00 2.24</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6.71 5.10 4.47</code></pre>
<p>Calculate clockwise angle between row and column segments connected by the origin.</p>
<p>As an example, two segments: G_R1 and E_C1, are joined illustrating the angle between them.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/segment-r1c1-angle-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>From the above equation, first element of matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(P_{ij}\)</span>) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P_{11} &amp; = \vec{R_1}cos\alpha_{11}\vec{C_1} \\
&amp; = 4.46\ cos(36.9)\ 6.71 \\
&amp; = 24
\end{split}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, to obtain the column vector <span class="math inline">\(P_{i1}\)</span>, we have following four elements resulting from the vector product.</p>
<pre><code>## [1]  24  21  15 -15</code></pre>
<p>Kronecker solution to matrix binding</p>
