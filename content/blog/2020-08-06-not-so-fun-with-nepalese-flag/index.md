# Anatomy of flag

The anatomy of flag is well described in [tipsntricks/readresort section](https://rookie.rbind.io/tipsntricks/readresort/2020-05-29-know-your-flag/) but the quirks of constructing it are not. I will be updating attending to complete the graphics as soon as I learn more.

So far, only this ugly shape is what I have here to show;
