## Some new announcement

There is supposed to be new div tip here (this tip is defined in a custom file called divtips.scss)

:::ohshit
My content goes in here and it is due to ohshit div.

<button data-balloon-length="fit" aria-label="What about something really big? This may surpass your window dimensions. Imagine you're on that boring class with that boring teacher and you didn't slept so well last night. Suddenly you're sleeping in class. Can you believe it?!" data-balloon-pos="up">My width will fit to element</button>
<button aria-label="I have big text!" class="tooltip-big-text tooltip-red" data-balloon-pos="up">I have big text!</button>
