An encounter with web content related to R, although for me it is usually random, is in general welcoming. The [link](http://kbroman.org/blog/2017/05/01/caching-blogdown/) to this amazing feature building on the fact that using a markdown language is rather a pleasant way to write a blog post in a fully costumizable website all by yourself is enticing, to me at least. I started weaving thoughts right at the moment.
